### 🙃Why I Created This

 I created this collection of portals for you to have a single, convenient place to access different government resources for reporting various types of crime and online issues.

Instead of having to search for each specific portal individually (like the cybercrime portal, for reporting morphed photos, the one for lost phones, or the one for financial fraud), you can find them all listed together.
